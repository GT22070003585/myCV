     <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p> <div id="aboutme"></div> My name is Georgiana Theophanous and I am 21 years old. I am from Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, where I am currently living.
            I recently graduated from Cardiff University in Wales, where I went to pursue a Physics degree. Even though I lived in Cardiff
            for only 3 years I consider it my second home, since it's where I gained the opportunity to live away from home and become more 
            independant. Living in a different country and having only yourself to rely on played a major role in my character development
            and it's an experience that I would recommend for everyone.     
         </p>
